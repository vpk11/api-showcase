### Docker SetupðŸš€
> If permission issue -> run as `sudo`
- Run container:
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```
  > `-d` will run the containers in the background 
- Check container status:
```shell
docker-compose ps
```
  > `docker-compose ps -a` will list status of containers that exited with error
- Create DB:
```shell
docker-compose exec app bundle exec rake db:create
```
- Run migrations:
```shell
docker-compose exec app bundle exec rake db:migrate
```
- Check container logs:
```shell
docker-compose logs
```
- Stop container:
```shell
docker-compose down
```
- Rails console:
```shell
docker-compose exec app bundle exec rails c
```
- Delete all containers:
```shell
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
```
  > In almost all cases `docker-compose down` removes the containers. Use the above command to cross-verify.
- Delete all volumes:
```shell
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
```
And now you can visit the site with the URL http://localhost:3000
